# opensea-zapier
Zapier code block for OpenSea API

Copy/paste this code into a Zapier code block (Javascript) to call the OpenSea API within Zapier. Provide wallet address of user and contract address of collection to get an array of token ids, which each represent an NFT the user owns from said collection. (Eg. If you provide it my wallet address and contract address for PixelBeasts, this code block will return an array of token_ids - one for each PixelBeast I own).

This is not tested with every collection, may need to adjust.
